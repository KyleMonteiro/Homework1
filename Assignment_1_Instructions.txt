Assignment 1


This assignment is a review of COP1334 skills.  

Download and examine file ‘patientFile.txt’.  It represents data for patients on the floor of a hospital.  Each record, i.e. row, has the patient’s last name, first name and the last four temperature readings.

Your program is to read the file into an array of struct and print out the first and last names of all the patients.  Then your program will prompt for a last name and print the average of the four temperatures for that patient to an accuracy of two decimal places.  Your program will prompt in a loop until the user enters ‘stop’.

Use this as the struct:
struct Patient {
	string lastName;
	string firstName;
	float temps [4];
};

It is not enough for your program to meet the operational requirements of the problem.  You must also demonstrate you’re ability to write functions.  

void readPatientFile (Patient p [], int& c)
This function reads the patient file into the array p and returns the number of patients in variable c.

void printPatients (Patient p [], int c) 
This function prints the first and last names of all the patients in array p.

void checkTemps (Patient p [], int c, string n, float& average) 
This function searches the array p for the patient whose last name is n and returns the average of patient n’s four temperature readings.  If patient n is not found, return 0.  Note: If you prefer, you can write this as a value returning function.

Program design is important.
Programs that are otherwise correct, but do not decompose the problem using the specified functions will receive a maximum grade of 85.

Programs that are otherwise correct, but do not use an array of Patient to hold the file data will receive a maximum grade of 60.

Submissions that do not compile will receive a grade of 0.
